                CASTED! is a student media publication that aims to tell the stories of students on campus. We platform experiences, amplify voices, and capture stories that matter. We’re not just ink on paper; we’re the megaphone for every student with something to say. Whether you’re penning an exposé on the state of waste disposal on campus (it’s bad) or sharing your epic adventure, CASTED! is your stage.
